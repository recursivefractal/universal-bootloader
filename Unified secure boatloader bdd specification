# Unified Secure Bootloader: BDD Specification

## Feature: Core Contract Validation and Registration

```gherkin
Feature: Core Contract Validation and Registration
  As a market framework
  I want to validate and register contracts
  So that only valid contracts enter the system

  Background:
    Given the bootloader is initialized
    And the bootloader is in the "Idle" state

  Scenario: Submitting a valid contract
    Given a contract with id, version and segment
    When the contract is submitted to the bootloader
    Then the bootloader should:
      - Transition to the "Validation" state
      - Validate the contract
      - Register the contract
      - Add the contract to its market segment
      - Transition to the "Active" state
      - Return a success response
      - Emit appropriate events

  Scenario: Submitting a contract with missing fields
    Given a contract missing required fields
    When the contract is submitted to the bootloader
    Then the bootloader should:
      - Transition to the "Validation" state
      - Identify the missing fields
      - Transition back to the "Idle" state
      - Return an error response
      - Emit appropriate events

  Scenario: Submitting a contract when not in Idle state
    Given the bootloader is in the "Active" state
    When a contract is submitted to the bootloader
    Then the bootloader should:
      - Not transition state
      - Return an error response with "INVALID_STATE"
      - Not register the contract
```

## Feature: OTA Security and Update Management

```gherkin
Feature: OTA Security and Update Management
  As a system administrator
  I want to securely update the bootloader and contracts
  So that only authorized changes can be made to the system

  Background:
    Given the bootloader is initialized
    And at least one public key is registered

  Scenario: Registering a public key
    When I register a public key with ID "admin"
    Then the key should be added to the authorized keys list
    And a "key-registered" event should be emitted

  Scenario: Processing a valid self-update
    Given a public key "admin" is registered
    When I submit an update package with:
      | Field     | Value                |
      | version   | 1.1.0                |
      | code      | (define test-var 1)  |
      | signature | <valid signature>    |
      | keyId     | admin                |
      | target    | self                 |
    Then the update should be staged
    And an "update-staged" event should be emitted

  Scenario: Applying a staged self-update
    Given a self-update has been staged
    When I trigger the bootloader to apply the update
    Then the update code should be executed
    And the bootloader version should be updated to the new version
    And an "update-applied" event should be emitted

  Scenario: Rejecting an update with invalid signature
    Given a public key "admin" is registered
    When I submit an update package with an invalid signature
    Then the update should be rejected with "INVALID_SIGNATURE"
    And no update should be staged

  Scenario: Rejecting a downgrade attempt
    Given the current bootloader version is "1.1.0"
    When I submit an update package with version "1.0.0"
    Then the update should be rejected with "VERSION_DOWNGRADE_REJECTED"
    And no update should be staged

  Scenario: Processing a contract update
    Given a public key "admin" is registered
    When I submit an update package for a contract
    Then the contract update should be applied
    And an "update-applied" event should be emitted
```

## Feature: Event System

```gherkin
Feature: Event System
  As a system component
  I want to receive events from the bootloader
  So that I can react to system changes

  Background:
    Given the bootloader is initialized

  Scenario: Subscribing to events
    When I subscribe to the "registered" event
    And a contract is registered
    Then my event handler should be called with the contract data

  Scenario: Unsubscribing from events
    Given I am subscribed to the "registered" event
    When I unsubscribe from the event
    And a contract is registered
    Then my event handler should not be called
```

## Future Extensions

The following features are planned for future patch versions:

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.1) - Enhanced Validation
Feature: Enhanced Contract Validation
  As a market framework
  I want to validate contract dependencies and signatures
  So that contracts have proper relationships and verification
```

```gherkin

Feature: Competitive Weighting
  As a market framework
  I want to calculate and enforce competitive weighting
  So that market participants are incentivized appropriately
```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.3) - Market Dynamics
Feature: Market Dynamics and Conflict Resolution
  As a market framework

```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.5) - Performance Optimization
Feature: Validation Caching and Performance Optimization
  As a system administrator
  I want contract validation to be optimized
  So that repeated validations are faster and more efficient
```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.6) - Granular Security Permissions
Feature: Role-Based Contract Security
  As a system administrator
  I want to define granular permissions for different keys
  So that security responsibilities can be properly delegated
  
  Scenario: Defining Key Permissions
    Given I have registered an admin key
    When I create a permission contract specifying:
      | Key ID       | Resource          | Permission Level |
      | contract-key | Contract Updates  | Write            |
      | market-key   | Market Parameters | Read, Write      |
      | audit-key    | All Contracts     | Read             |
    Then each key should only be able to perform their allowed operations
    And unauthorized operations should be rejected
    
  Scenario: Multi-Signature Requirements
    Given I have defined a critical system resource
    When I set a multi-signature requirement of 3 out of 5 keys
    Then updates to that resource should require valid signatures from 3 different authorized keys
    And updates with fewer signatures should be rejected
```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.7) - Post-Quantum Cryptography
Feature: Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms
  As a security administrator
  I want to upgrade the system to use quantum-resistant cryptography
  So that the system remains secure against quantum computing attacks
  
  Scenario: Crypto Algorithm Upgrade
    Given the bootloader supports cryptographic algorithm plugins
    When I deploy a post-quantum algorithm update
    Then the system should use the new algorithms for all key operations
    And previously registered keys should be migrated to quantum-resistant formats
    
  Scenario: Hybrid Cryptography Transition
    Given some parts of the system still require classical cryptography
    When I enable hybrid cryptographic mode
    Then the system should use both classical and post-quantum algorithms as appropriate
    And all security-critical operations should use quantum-resistant methods
```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.8) - Market-Driven Security Response
Feature: Market-Driven Security Response
  As a market administrator
  I want to automatically adjust incentives based on security threats
  So that defensive measures scale with attack severity
  
  Scenario: Threat Detection and Response
    Given the system detects a new attack pattern
    When the threat level is assessed as "high"
    Then the system should automatically increase incentives for defensive contracts
    And the market should broadcast a security contract opportunity
    
  Scenario: Attacker Containment Through Markets
    Given a detected intrusion attempt
    When malicious activity is identified within a market segment
    Then the system should create targeted security contract opportunities
    And increase rewards for successful containment strategies
    
  Scenario: Converting Attack Behaviors to Defensive Improvements
    Given an attack technique has been successfully contained
    When the attack pattern is analyzed
    Then the system should create contract templates for permanent defenses
    And offer bounties for implementing systemic protections
```

```gherkin
# FUTURE EXTENSION (v1.0.9) - Network Effect Scaling
Feature: Security Scaling Through Network Effects
  As a platform provider
  I want security strength to scale with participant count
  So that growth improves rather than weakens security
  
  Scenario: Distributed Verification
    Given the system has N active participants
    When a security-critical operation is performed
    Then the verification work should be distributed across multiple nodes
    And the verification confidence should increase with participant count
    
  Scenario: Collaborative Defense
    Given multiple participants detect similar attack patterns
    When these patterns are reported to the network
    Then the system should synthesize a coordinated defense strategy
    And distribute the defense mechanism across the network
    
  Scenario: Reputation-Based Security Contributions
    Given participants have security contribution history
    When security contracts are issued
    Then allocation should prioritize participants with strong security track records
    And successful contributions should improve security reputation scores
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Core Functionality**: The initial implementation focuses only on contract validation, registration, and secure OTA updates.

2. **Security Model**: The OTA security uses cryptographic verification to ensure only authorized updates are applied.

3. **Lisp Runtime**: A minimal Lisp interpreter enables bootloader and contract extensibility through code updates.

4. **Event System**: An event-driven architecture allows components to react to system changes asynchronously.

5. **Versioning**: Uses semantic versioning to prevent downgrades and ensure compatible updates.

6. **Future Extensions**: All additional functionality will be added through secure OTA updates, maintaining backward compatibility.
